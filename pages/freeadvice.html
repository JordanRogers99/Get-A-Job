                <h3>Do I need to create a special CV for the arts?</h3>
                <p>In short, we would say yes. It is crucial to the application process to show that
                    you are looking for a job in the arts specifically. We have put together a guide, 
                    alongside a template, that will help you better understand what goes into this.
                    Don't worry, we are assuming that you have no paid experience yet.

                <h3>What experience do I need to land my first position?</h3>
                <p>The experience you need to get your first job in the art industry is varied and

                    with that differ from standard employment?</h3>
                <p>In the case of working freelance, there are many differences. In the UK, these can

                <h3>Can anyone make it in the art industry?</h3>
                <p>We like to believe that it is possible for anybody. In the case of our website, we 
                    are working on the English speaking world because the language of the founders is English.
                    In time, we would like to expand worldwide. Our feeling is that it is not neccesarily 
                    the easiest industry to get into, we must be creative and approach this in an abstract way.
                    There are no gauranteed entry points, but through trial and error, mixed with consistency, 
                    we do believe that it is possible for anyone.
