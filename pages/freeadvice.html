                <h3>Do I need to create a special CV for the arts?</h3>
                <p>In short, we would say yes. It is crucial to the application process to show that
                    you are looking for a job in the arts specifically. We have put together a guide, 
                    alongside a template, that will help you better understand what goes into this.
                    Don't worry, we are assuming that you have no paid experience yet.

                <h3>What experience do I need to land my first position?</h3>
                <p>The experience you need to get your first job in the art industry is varied and 
                    depends heavily on what you are looking to achieve. We believe that...

                <h3>I am interested in working freelance, what sort of issues will I need to contend
                    with that differ from standard employment?</h3>
                <p>In the case of working freelance, there are many differences. In the UK, these can 
                    be as mundane as tax differences or as...

                <h3>Can anyone make it in the art industry?</h3>
                <p>We like to believe that it is possible for anybody. In the case of our website, we 
                    are working on the English speaking world because the language of the founders is English.
                    In time, we would like to expand worldwide. Our feeling is that it is not neccesarily 
                    the easiest industry to get into, we must be creative and approach this in an abstract way.
                    There are no gauranteed entry points, but through trial and error, mixed with consistency, 
                    we do believe that it is possible for anyone.

            <h3>Will I need a portfolio?</h3>
            <p>Whilst you may occasionally get interviews without a portfolio, there is no reasonable way to tell you
                that you don't need one. The ability to get a job in the arts world is not based on your qualifications, at
                least not to the same level as in other industries. It does help, if we are completely honest, but we believe
                that it is more of a meritocricy than other areas of empoyment, primarily because this is built-in to the industry,
                Your portfolio will represent you and your abilities and it is something you can build and constantly improve
                upon.

                <h3>Am I too old to enter into the arts industry?</h3>
                <p>You are never too old to find a career in the arts industry. It can be intimidating due to the large
                    number of younger artists and university graduates, but companies that focus on art are going to see
                    the same life experience and usefulness in an older person that any other company would see. Coming 
                    from a career in another field will give you a new outlook on what's going on, and perhaps a stronger
                    work ethic in some cases!
