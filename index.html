    <div class="opening">
    <p div class="first">The job listings that are used on our site are taken from a variety of areas of the internet. This
        job board is aimed at being something different for artists. We want to offer multiple sections 
        that are aimed at artists with varying levels of experience. Often, when I look for jobs as an artist,
        it can be hard to find exactly what you are looking for. As an entry level artist, perhaps a graduate
        or somebody that hasn't studied but is looking to start a new career, it can be difficult to 
        whittle the job areas down to exactly what you need. As a more experienced artist, it can be 
        hard to find roles that fulfil your salary expectations.
    </p>

    <p div class="second">Aside from these issues that we aim to solve for the artist community in the UK and the US, with expanding areas
        in the future, we are also looking to offer support to artists that aren't sure how to get into the 
        industry. If you did not have the luxury of a formal education in the arts world, it can be difficult
        to know where to start. We offer a range of options and can help to advise you on your best next step
        in the industry to work towards that first job.
    </p>

    <p div class="third">On this site, you can make an account, save and find job applications, receive help from people with
        experience, and start to make your way in the indsutry or find your logical next step. This is an 
        exciting world and this company is founded by those with a passion for art, and careers in the art world.
        You can find advice sections that are completely for free, and you can also pay a small fee for 
        very direct advice that is suited to you specifically.
