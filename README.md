# Get-A-Job
I am building a website, aimed at getting jobs for artists. My current plan is to:

1. Create the ability to login to the website.

2. Ensure that the website can save the details of the person logging in, and once they are logged in they will be sent back to the homepage but a 'my profile' tab will be added.

3. Enable users of the site with profiles to save job ads.

4. Dinstingush between jobs they have already applied for, and jobs they haven't.

5. Create the ability to take payment on the site for A. Mentoring & B. Posting job ads

6. Put ads on the site. To do this, I will just include my own websites, and in future the apparatus will be there for paid ads once the traffic is high.

7. Distinguish between jobs they have seen and jobs they haven't, making the former invisible unless they specifically press a button that says otherwise.

8. Create a filter menu where users can filter jobs by salary, experience level, location etc.

9. Create an app for the site.

10. Ensure that the app works well in mobile browsers.

11. Have a 'test your Adobe skills' area where the user can see a desired result and at the end they can look at the solutions sheet and see if they used the correct methods.

12. In tandem with the above, post tutorials and link to the best Youtube tutorials, watchable on the site.
